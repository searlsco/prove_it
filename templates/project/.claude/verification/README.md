# Manual verification artifacts (only when needed)

Prefer automated verification via `./scripts/test`.

If you must do manual verification (e.g., UX nuance, hardware interaction, external dependency), record:

- What you verified
- Exact steps
- Environment (OS/browser/device)
- Evidence (screenshots, logs, screen recordings)
- How to automate next time (if feasible)
